1. 'Projet_Biostat_Lan_YANG.ipynb': 
   The whole model codes on google colab notebook format for this project, the datasets(data.rar and labels.csv in this file) are charged through url links in this notebook.
   To run it in google colab, you can download the .ipynb file or just click on the 'Open In Colab' at the head of the code.    
   Running the whole codes can take about 10 mins. 

3. 'Test_on_featrues_selection_Lan_YANG.ipynb': 
   For the test on features selection using random forest method, finally, number of estimators = 10 turns to be the minimum number of estimators to achieve the optimal performance, at this number, 193 features (genes) are selected in this project, nearly the number of test datasets. 
   Running the whole codes can take about 7 mins.
